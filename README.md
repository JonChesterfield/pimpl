# pimpl
Implementation of C++'s pointer to implementation idiom

I like separation of interface from implementation, but dislike using heap allocation and a unique pointer to achieve it. This repo (will at some point) hold an implementation that doesn't require heap allocation. 

Whether this is worthwhile or not depends on the extend to which I can minimise the boilerplate involved.
